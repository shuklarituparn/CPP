/* The shared_ptr type is a smart pointer in the C++ standard library that is designed for scenarios in which more than one owner might have to manage the lifetime of the object in memory. After you initialize a shared_ptr you can copy it, pass it by value in function arguments, and assign it to other shared_ptr instances. All the instances point to the same object, and share access to one "control block" that increments and decrements the reference count whenever a new shared_ptr is added, goes out of scope, or is reset. When the reference count reaches zero, the control block deletes the memory resource and itself. */

/* 
shared_ptr is also helpful in C++ Standard Library containers when you're using algorithms that copy elements. You can wrap elements in a shared_ptr, and then copy it into other containers with the understanding that the underlying memory is valid as long as you need it, and no longer. The following example shows how to use the remove_copy_if algorithm on shared_ptr instances in a vector.

/* C++ has two built-in types for characters, char, which is used with std::string, and wchar_t, which is used with std::wstring. If you write a string literal in regular quotes, C++ treats it as an string made of chars, which can be used with std::string. To tell C++ that you're trying to make a string literal made of wchar_ts - which is what you'll need to use to work with std::wstring, you need to prefix it with an L because that's just how C++ is defined. */

/* This line of code invokes the remove_copy_if() algorithm, which takes four arguments:

    v.begin() and v.end(): the range of elements in the input vector v that we want to filter and copy.
    back_inserter(v2): an iterator that points to the end of the output vector v2, indicating where the copied elements should be inserted.
    [] (shared_ptr<Song> s) { return s->artist.compare(L"Bob Dylan") == 0; }: a lambda function that takes a shared_ptr<Song> object s and returns a bool. The lambda function is used to determine whether a given element in the input range should be filtered out or not. In this case, the lambda function checks whether the artist name of the current Song object pointed to by s is equal to "Bob Dylan", and returns true if it is.

The remove_copy_if() algorithm copies all elements from the input range that do not satisfy the condition specified by the lambda function, and inserts them into v2 using the back_inserter iterator. Therefore, v2 will contain all Song objects from v that have an artist name different from "Bob Dylan". */
