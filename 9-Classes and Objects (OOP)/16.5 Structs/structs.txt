Cpp also supports structs.

*In structs the member are public by default while in the class the member are private by default.


class Person{

std::string name;
std::String get_name();
};

Person p;
p.name="Frank";  //error-private
std::cout<<p.get_name(); //error-Private


Struct Person{
std::string name;
std::String get_name();
};

Person p;
p.name="Frank";  //no-error
std::cout<<p.get_name();

Structs:

Use structs with passive object with public access

*Don't declare methods in structs


Class:

*Use class for active objects with private access
*Implement getters and setters as needed
*Implement member methods as needed
