Make files are basically make files that have the various instruction on how to make  a program

/*They generally start with something like:

Default:
    g++ main.cpp -o.out

*/


We can do the same things with cmake:

we need to specify the source folder and the build folder and in the build folder we'll have the make files.

Most people make a build folder and they make the cmake there.

better to use /out/build

to make that directory we can write

"mkdir -p /out/build"

make that directory and then go into it and make a new file called 

"CMakeLists.txt" then open the terminal and type


cmake -S ../../ -B .

the dot specifies that this folder where we are now is the place to make the makefiles

../../ is the command to specify that the source code is two folder back.

or if we are in the directory where our code is and we want to build the code in the different directory.

cmake -S . -B out/build/

in the CMakeLists.txt we can specify simple things like minimum version required.

like:-

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.26.2)
