Make files are basically make files that have the various instruction on how to make  a program

/*They generally start with something like:

Default:
    g++ main.cpp -o.out

*/


We can do the same things with cmake:

we need to specify the source folder and the build folder and in the build folder we'll have the make files.

Most people make a build folder and they make the cmake there.

better to use /out/build

make that directory and then go into it and type 

cmake -S ../../ -B .

the dot specifies that this folder where we are now is the place to make the makefiles

../../ is the command to specify that the source code is two folder back.
