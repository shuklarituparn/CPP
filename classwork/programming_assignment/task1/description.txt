Implement a generic class Stack using templates, which represents a stack data structure. The class should have the following public member functions:

Stack(): Default constructor that initializes an empty stack.
void push(const T& element): Adds a new element to the top of the stack.
void pop(): Removes the top element from the stack.
T& top(): Returns a reference to the top element of the stack.
bool empty() const: Returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise.


The class should throw an exception if any of the following conditions are met:
The pop or top functions are called on an empty stack.


The push function is called on a full stack 
(the maximum size of the stack is 100 elements).
