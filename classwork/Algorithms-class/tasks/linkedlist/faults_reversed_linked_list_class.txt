The code has a few design issues that could be improved:

    Redundant code: There is a lot of redundant code in this implementation. The display_linked_list function is defined twice, once in the List class and once in the reversed_linked_list class. This could be avoided by making the display_linked_list function a member function of the Node struct instead.

    Unnecessary use of pointers: The Node struct and the List and reversed_linked_list classes use raw pointers to manage memory. This is error-prone and could lead to memory leaks. Instead, it would be better to use smart pointers like std::unique_ptr or std::shared_ptr to manage memory.

    Inefficient implementation of the reverse_linked_list function: The reverse_linked_list function uses a iterative approach to reverse the linked list. A recursive implementation would be more concise and easier to understand.

    Poor naming: The class reversed_linked_list is poorly named. It does not actually represent a reversed linked list, but rather a linked list that has been reversed. A better name for this class would be ReversedLinkedList.

    No encapsulation: The Node struct is defined in the global scope, which can lead to naming conflicts. It would be better to define the Node struct inside the List class, and make it a private member of the class.

    No const correctness: The member functions of the List and reversed_linked_list classes that do not modify their objects should be declared as const member functions to enforce const correctness.

    No error handling: The implementation does not handle errors such as invalid input or memory allocation failures.

    No copy/move constructors/assignment operators: The implementation does not define copy/move constructors or assignment operators for the List and reversed_linked_list classes. This could lead to issues with object copying and assignment.

Overall, the code could benefit from better encapsulation, more efficient algorithms, improved memory management, and better error handling.
