In order to check the memory leak we can use the Valgrind memory leak checker

valgrind --leak-check=yes myprog arg1 arg2

where the command after check=yes is the command used to make the program

or we can use -fsanitize=address to check the memory leak

for a file called "main.cpp"

we can use "g++ -fsanitize=address main.cpp"
